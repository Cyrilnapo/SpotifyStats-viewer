## What 
This program allows you to search an artist and download on the best quality (that spotify provides) their album covers image.
## Why
Spotify doesn't allow you to just drag and drop or download their albums cover images on their platform. So instead of taking a screenshot or search on google, using this makes it easier.

And the main point also is, as an apprentice, I wanted to find something easy to do using an API so I could learn how it works + react interested me and that was an occasion to initiate myself to it.

## Using (local)

#### Prerequire node.js

```
cd *\spotifycovers\client
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
->localhost:3000
